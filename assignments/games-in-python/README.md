# Games in Python

In this assignment, you'll explore the foundations of game programming
using Python. You'll create a small text-based game where players make
choices, and the program responds with outcomes based on those choices.
This activity focuses on developing logic, managing state, and handling
user input in a fun, interactive way.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

1. Write and control the flow of a program using `if`/`else` and loops.
2. Prompt for and process input from a player.
3. Track information across multiple turns or events.
4. Use functions to organize code and avoid repetition.

## 🧩 Getting Started

Open `starter-code.py` for a basic framework. It includes:

- A main game loop
- Placeholder functions for game logic
- Comments with hints to guide you

Feel free to add new functions, classes, or additional features as you
see fit.

> multiple outcomes, or additional challenges. Have fun and be
> creative!
